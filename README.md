# README

This site is meant as a handy location to find and store recipes that you or
another user posted.

I built this site using Ruby, version 2.4.1p111, and Rails, version 5.1.4. It
incorporates the languages CSS and HTML as well as many gems. In particular, the
user authentication is built from scratch but incorporates the gem 'bcrypt',
version 3.1.7, which handles the hashing and secure storing of user passwords.

The site could be taken further by incorporating the abilities to make recipes
private and add friends with whom to share private recipes as well as sign-ins
from social identity providers like Google and Facebook.

The site is live on Heroku: https://recipe-eat.herokuapp.com/

A screencast of the site functionality is hosted by Youtube:

I would also appreciate any contributions to the repo!
